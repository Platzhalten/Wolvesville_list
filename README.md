# branches 
There are usually 3 branches, the Master, the dev and another branch who's named on whatever I am currently working on. 

If you want to change something, you can do it in the dev branch, if you want to create something big, create a new branch of dev.

The Master branch should always work, the other branch should also work, but with more errors and unfinished features
