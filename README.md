# to run 
You need [Python](https://www.python.org/) and FreeSimpleGUI (if Tkinter is not pre-installed also Tkinter). 


then just run the main.py file

# translation
If you really bored and know a language that is not yet in the lang.json you can add it

just copy the placeholder down and put the right Translation in there

# branches 
There are usually 3 branches, the Master, the dev and another branch whos named on whatever I am currently working on. 

If you want to change something, you can do it in the dev branch, if you want to create something big, create a new branch of dev.

The Master branch should always work, the other branch should also work, but with more errors and unfinished features
